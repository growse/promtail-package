![Github Action status](https://github.com/growse/promtail-package/workflows/Build%2C%20package%20and%20deploy/badge.svg)

I needed a deb file for Grafana's Loki Promtail, so I made this. Result gets put onto apt.growse.com.

Both amd and armhf debs are currently produced.

```
deb https://apttoo.growse.com/ stablish main
```
